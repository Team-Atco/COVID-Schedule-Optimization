# COVID-Schedule-Optimization
This code was part of a project for the PIMS Math^Industry 2020 workshop.

We report on a two-week COVID-19 motivated project to create employee schedules aimed at limiting the percentage of the workforce in the workplace at any time while keeping associated commute time to a minimum. The project was structured as an optimization problem. Genetic algorithms were explored, adapted and implemented. Preliminary results suggest this as a promising avenue justifying further efforts.
